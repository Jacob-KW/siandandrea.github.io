												<h3>Assignment Brief</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In this assignment, we had to work collaboratively within our allocated groups to conduct extensive research and create a Visual Digital Magazine. Each team member contributed a 1200-word article with compelling visuals,, utilising Adobe InDesign for consistent layout. We had to maintain uniformity in font and style throughout the magazine while allowing individual topics and research to shine. The outcome to be a unified yet visually distinct digital publication reflecting our collective efforts.

												<h3>Personal Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In this engaging assignment, our assigned group of four created a compelling Visual Digital Magazine. While we each penned our individual articles, the magazine really came together during the collaborative design phase. 

											</p>
											<p>
												Eager to challenge myself, I took on the task of designing the front page and adverts in addition to my article, delving into the intricacies of Adobe InDesign (which I had no prior experience with) with the guidance of a specialist. 

											</p>
											<p>
												The prospect of a professionally printed version for our portfolio added an extra layer of motivation. Opting to create our own magazine concept, we named it “Forward,” focusing on the future of fashion. This innovative approach garnered us praise and allowed our articles to seamlessly integrate with a loose yet cohesive theme. 

											</p>
											<p>
												My article, exploring the discourse on reselling and its potential impact on gentrification, featured insights from an interview with my personal tutor Lizzy De Bruin, the Inventory Manager at Depop.
											</p>
											<p>
												The culmination of our efforts resulted in a 2nd place for the magazine's aesthetics, a special teamwork award, and the coveted 1st place overall for our degree, earning us professionally printed versions of our magazine.
