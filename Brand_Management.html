												<h3>Assignment Brief</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This assignment involved a concise study of an assigned brand, including its history, product segmentation, and identity in assigned groups. We needed to cover a brief brand history and a visual segmentation of six products. Creatively, it involved designing a product and packaging. Strategically, it evaluated the product meaning, identity, and innovation, justifying the product name. We also needed to define the targeted customer segment, approximate the selling price, and outline the distribution strategy, concluding with an overview of brand study, design, strategy, and business considerations.

												<h3>Personal Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This assignment was a fantastic experience as our group, tasked with analysing the brand Lululemon, seamlessly collaborated to produce outstanding results. 

											</p>
											<p>
												Working in a group setting, which I particularly enjoy, allowed us to leverage our collective creativity efficiently. Taking a leadership role, I volunteered for the store observation and presentation tasks, consolidating everyone's contributions into a cohesive document. 

											</p>
											<p>
												Despite a last-minute setback with a group member dropping out, our well-established collaboration enabled us to delegate and deliver her slides effectively. 

											</p>
											<p>
												The culmination of our efforts resulted in a remarkable 1:1 grade, showcasing the effectiveness of our teamwork and adaptability.
