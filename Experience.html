												<h3>Language</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I have been lucky enough to have been surrounded by a variety of different cultures throughout my lifetime. Coming from a vibrant blend of cultures myself - being a mix of Italian, English and Welsh - as well as growing up in the predominantly Pakistani area of Walthamstow in East London, I have always had an appreciation for the rich perspectives different cultures bring.
											</p>
											<p>
												This was expanded upon once I began secondary school, moving to Essex in order to attend the language centred Anglo European School.
											</p>
											<p>
												During my time at Anglo, I was able to delve into many other cultures forming friendships with people from all over the world including. Sweden, Norway, Dubai, Portugal, France, Hungary and more!
											</p>
											<p>
												Already fluent in both English and Italian, I also had the opportunity to expand my language skills, taking lessons in German, French, Spanish and even a few taster lessons in Japanese, and Russian!
											</p>
											<p>
												My passion for French and Spanish blossomed into immersive experiences, with exchanges in Lyon, Dinan, Blanes, and a month long exchange to Granada. Although I had to juggle keeping up with my schoolwork whilst in Granada, living in Spain for a month helped me learn Spanish in a way that was impossible to learn in lessons, helping me receive a grade 9 at GCSE!
											</p>
											<p>
												I was lucky enough that our Sixth-form, offered the International Baccalaureate – one of only two state schools to offer it. I opted for A-IB (a blend of both a-levels as IBs), as one of my favourite subjects Drama was not offered as part of the IB. I am grateful for this choice as it allowed me to compare the two, receiving the positives for both.

												<h3>Drama</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Theatre and performing has always been a passion of mine since primary school. I have been lucky enough to be a part of many experiences due to this. I was a member of the International Drama Academy, I did work experience in my schools drama department, I led group rehearsals during my school plays, and I organised a special event for my schools version of the Eisteddfod.

											</p>
											<p>
												Drama has been an extremely valuable tool, helping me with presentation skills, diction, projection, and overall confidence.

												<h3>Psychology & Sociology</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												With both of my parents having worked as social workers for the NHS, I have been fortunate to grow up understanding in more depth why people behave the way that they do. I studied both Psychology and Sociology at A-level in order to further deepen this understanding. 

											</p>
											<p>
												As part of my Bronze DofE, I carried out some volunteering work for a Young Carers Group at my local YMCA, providing respite for young carers. This gave me a greater empathy for peoples situations which we often have no insight into.

											</p>
											<p>
												As a result of this, I led a mental health awareness day at my school, affiliated with Young Minds, called Hello Yellow. This event raised over £100 for charities helping with youth mental health.

												<h3>London & Nottingham</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I chose to live in Nottingham and commute to London for university, a unique decision that reflects my inclination to avoid the easy path for excitement and enrichment (also making for great small talk!).

											</p>
											<p>
												One of the reasons for this was because my parents and my little sister moved back to Italy as I began University, and so I decided to move in with my long term boyfriend, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. This has been a great decision as I have had the joy of experiencing the magic and opportunities that London brings as well as the beauty and social life that Nottingham has to offer!
