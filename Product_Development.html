												<h3>Assignment Brief</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Given the opportunity to be selected to present at ASOS's headquarters, we were assigned 
												with creating a trend report for AW/23 within a chosen accessories department, showcasing 
												our knowledge of sourcing, manufacturing, sustainability, and cost as well as discussing 
												and distinguishing between concept, and market led trends.

												<h3>Personal Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Upon hearing about the opportunity to present at the ASOS headquarters I immediately knew that 
												it was an experience that I wanted to take part in. It was a great motivator and really prompted 
												me to think outside of the project brief itself in order to ensure my project stood out. 
											</p>
											<p>
												This module introduced me to WGSN and its wealth of industry reports. I explored every lingerie 
												trend prediction report I could find for 2023 and created a comprehensive word document with all 
												my findings before compiling the most common and relevant ones into my report. I absolutely loved 
												the blend of creativity in terms of presentation and the depth of research needed for forecasting. 
											</p>
											<p>
												After having presented my report to my class I was delighted to hear that I had been selected to 
												present to the ASOS panel. This was most definitely the highlight of this module. I was proud to 
												receive a high 2:1 and to be awarded first place by the ASOS panel!
