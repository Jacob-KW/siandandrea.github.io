												<h3>Assignment Brief</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The assignment brief tasked us with presenting essential elements of our expansion strategy. 
												The key components included introducing the chosen country for expansion, justifying the 
												selection, discussing relevant indicators used in the decision-making process, outlining 
												the chosen route to market, and providing a brief overview of main competitors in the 
												selected country. The overarching goal was to present these aspects cohesively within 
												a 3-5 minute timeframe during the seminar.

												<h3>Personal Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Navigating the initial challenges of this assignment was quite a journey, especially when delving into the intricate details of various European countries to inform a well-founded opinion for The White Company's expansion. My eagerness to position myself as a strong candidate for this opportunity heightened after a remarkable experience at ASOS. 

											</p>
											<p>
												Being half Italian, I instinctively recognised the resonance between Italian culture and The White Company's values, marked by shared tastes, a commitment to quality materials like linen, and a mutual emphasis on wellness. Conducting a thorough economic analysis using Statista and Global data, I pinpointed Italy as a promising location for TWC, honing in on the fashion hub of Milan. 

											</p>
											<p>
												A pivotal moment occurred during a one-on-one meeting with my lecturer, who happened to share my Italian heritage. Her endorsement of Italy as an ideal expansion destination boosted my confidence. We delved into potential partnerships and sponsors, adding layers of depth to my approach.
											</p>
											<p>
												After having delivered my presentation to my class, I was delighted to hear I had been selected to present at The White Company. Stepping into their stunning premises, the team's warmth and hospitality, coupled with a comprehensive tour and insightful feedback, surpassed my expectations. The engaging on-the-spot questioning provided a unique experience, setting it apart from my encounter with ASOS. This entire journey was undeniably an amazing learning experience.
