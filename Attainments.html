												<h3>Online Trade Assistant - Harrods</h3>
												<h3>21/09/2023 - 11/10/2023</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Thrilled to be recommended by my course leader for the only paid work experience position, I stepped into the challenging yet exciting role of a Trade Assistant at Harrods. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Admittedly, I wasn't well-versed in luxury or Excel, but the warm welcome and trust from the Online Trade team made all the difference. From day one, I was tasked with the live merchandising of 'Just In', 'Best Sellers,' and various 'Edits’ independently. The team's trusting approach allowed me to actively participate in an array of tasks including weekly competitor tables, meetings, and contribute to various projects. This included entrusting me to update the company categorisation guide after a suggestion I made in a meeting. Little did I expect to gain such a wealth of experience and trust so quickly. 
											</p>
											<p>
												This journey wasn't just about tasks; it was about navigating a hybrid work environment, gaining confidence in tech, and diving deep into the world of luxury retail. Thanks to this enriching experience, I now feel more at home with technology, and my brand awareness has soared. Grateful for the supportive team at Harrods, I emerged not just with skills but with a newfound appreciation for the human side of work.
